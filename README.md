#How to Play

## Goal
- The goal is to write as little points as possible.

## Values
- Joker: 0 points
- Ace: 1 point
- Numbers: Value on Card
- Other Cards: 10 points

## Rules
- Every player gets 5 cards
- A user can put down one of the following options
  - single card
  - 2 or more cards of the same value 
  - 3 or more cards in a row (same colour)
- A user can call Yaniv once they have less than 5 points on hand
  - If no other user has equal or less points, this player writes 0 points. They win this round.
  - If another user has equal or less points, this player writes 25 points plus whatever amount they had when they called out Yaniv (e.g. 25 + 4)
- If a user reaches more than 100 points, they are out of the game
There is 2 ways to reduce points
 - If a user reaches exactly 50 points, their score will be halfed to 25
  - If a user reaches exaclty 100 points, their score will be halfed to 50 for the first time and reduced to 0 points on the second time
